# bug-tracker
<b>Tools used:</b> Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React, RESTful APIs
<br>I developed a bug tracking system enabling small development teams to manage projects, users and tickets (issues) raised.
I used React to build a responsive frontend supported by a secure Node.js and Express backend with
MongoDB for storing and fetching data and implemented JWT-based authentication, role-based access and centralized tracking.
